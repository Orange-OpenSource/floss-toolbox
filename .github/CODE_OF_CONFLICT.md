Code of Conflict
----------------

The floss-toolbox development effort is a kind of personal process just 
like open source (or not) software projects. Your code and ideas
behind it will be carefully reviewed, maybe resulting in critique and
criticism. The review will sometimes require improvements to the
code before it can be included in the project. Know that this happens
because everyone involved wants to see cool and useful features for
the project.

If however, anyone feels personally abused, threatened, or otherwise
uncomfortable due to this process, that is not acceptable. If so,
please contact Orange Open Source Gouvernance at
<opensource.contact@orange.com>, or the individual members, and they
will work to resolve the issue to the best of their ability. 

As a reviewer of code, please strive to keep things civil and focused on
the technical issues involved. We are all humans, and frustrations can
be high on both sides of the process.
