# Play with GitHub web API

## Project tree

1. _github_ contains all scripts and programs to play with GitHub API using Octokit or GH
2. _github/licenses_ contains third-party licenses files
3. _github/utils_ contains utility scripts calls by the wizard

## Prerequisites

- Ruby Gem: `octokit 6.1.1`
- Ruby Gem: `git 1.18.0`
- Ruby 2.7.1

- Create a [GitHub personal token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and define it in the _configuration.rb_ file for the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` variable.
- Define the _GitHub_ organization name in the _configuration.rb_ file for the `GITHUB_ORGANIZATION_NAME` variable. It will allow to send requests to query and modify your organization.
- Define also the logins of the GitHub adminsitrators of your organization so as to prevent to change their permisssion for example.

This project expects to have several third-party elements available and already added in your system, like [Octokit Ruby gem](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org), [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and [Git Ruby gem](https://github.com/ruby-git/ruby-git)
None of them have been modified nor distributed.

Thus there is no composition nor [aggregation (mere or not)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#MereAggregation) with them but these components are also called by the system calls mainly, except for _Octokit_ and _Git_ Ruby gems under MIT licenses.

To check preconditions, run:

```shell
bash dry-run.sh
```

## Prepare project

```shell
gem install octokit
gem install git

### Make a year review of the GitHub organization

You will need to define a *.env* file with the GitHub API token for key *GITHUB_API_TOKEN*, the organization name and some settings.
Here the organization name is *Orange-OpenSource*, replace with your own and add the suitable token.

See for example:
```text
GITHUB_API_TOKEN=your-token
ORGANIZATION_NAME=Orange-OpenSource
TOP_N_PROG_LANG=5
TOP_N_LEAST_PROG_LANG=5
TOP_N_LICENSES=5
TOP_N_CONTRIBUTORS_OVERALL=10
TOP_N_CONTRIBUTORS_FOR_YEAR=10
TOP_N_REPOS_MOST_COMMITS=5
```

Run the following command to compute a year review of the organization

```shell
# Do not forget to install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For year 2024
python3.8 github-year-review.py --year 2024

# For year 20Â°24 and commits counts computing (can be time expansive)
python3.8 github-year-review.py --year 2024 --count-commits
```

# Play with GitHub CLI (GH)

## Prerequisites

- GitHub CLI: version 1.3.1 (2021-09-30)
- Ruby 2.7.1
- Python 3

Some configuration details must be defined (in _configuration.rb_), like:
1. `GITHUB_ORGANIZATION_NAME` to store the name of the organization
2. `REPOSITORIES_CLONE_LOCATION_PATH` location of the clone sif you want to make a dump of the organisation repositories
3. `REPOSITORIES_CLONE_URL_JSON_KEY` to choose the JSON key to get the repository URL from GitHub API

This project expects to have several third-party elements available and already added in your system, like [[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org), [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli)
None of them have been modified nor distributed.

Thus there is no composition nor [aggregation (mere or not)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#MereAggregation) with them but these components are also called by the system calls mainly.

To check preconditions, run:

```shell
bash dry-run.sh
```

## Prepare project

```shell
brew install gh
```

## Features

### Make a backup of organization repositories

_Keywords: #organisation #GitHub #repositories #clones #dump_

This feature allows to clone all repositories of the defined GitHub organization and save them in a specific folder.

Run the following command:
```shell
bash GitHubWizard.sh backup-all-repositories-from-org
```

This script will trigger the _gh_ client which may ask you to athenticate to the GitHub API.
Then the Shell script will pick configuration details from the Ruby configuration file; and triggers another Shell script for the data process. A Python code will be called too. Yep, I like scripting. And both Python, Ruby and Shell.
_So imagine a python eating ruby gems in a shell. Gorgeous isn't it?_

You need to define in the _configuration.rb_ files the Github organisation at **GITHUB_ORGANIZATION_NAME**.
You have to also define the location to store clones at **REPOSITORIES_CLONE_LOCATION_PATH**

**You should also have your _git_ environment ready, i.e. add your SSH private key if you clone by SSH for example.**

### Check if there are vulnerabilities alerts in organisation repositories

_Keywords: #organisation #GitHub #repositories #Dependabot #vulnerabilities_

This feature allows to check in all repositories of the GitHub organisation if there are projects witch vulnerabilities alerts.

Run the following command:
```shell
bash GitHubWizard.sh vulnerabilities-alerts-for-all-repositories
```

This script will trigger the _gh_ client which may ask you to authenticate to the GitHub API.
Then the Shell script will pick configuration details from the Ruby configuration file; and triggers another Shell script for the data process. A Python code will be called too to process JSON sent by GitHub API.

The Python code will process JSON data, the Shell script will previously make a CURL request to to GraphQL API.

You need to define in the _configuration.rb_ files the Github organisation at **GITHUB_ORGANIZATION_NAME** and also your GitHub personal token at **GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN**.

**You should also have your _git_ environment ready i.e. add your SSH private key if you clone by SSH for example. _gh_ must be installed, and python3 be ready.**

### Check if there are leaks in organisation repositories (using gitleaks)

_Keywords: #organisation #GitHub #repositories #leaks #gitleaks_

**Warning: This operation can take long time because of both Git histories and file trees parsing**

This feature allows to check in all repositories of the GitHub organisation if there are leaks using the _gitleaks_ tool.

Run the following command:
```shell
bash GitHubWizard.sh look-for-leaks
```

This script will trigger the _gh_ client which may ask you to authenticate to the GitHub API.
Then the Shell script will pick configuration details from the Ruby configuration file ; and triggers another Shell script for the data process. A Python code will be called too to process JSON sent by GitHub API.

The [gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) tool will be used to look inside the repository. To install it:

```shell
brew install gitleaks
```

You need to define in the _configuration.rb_ files the Github organisation at **GITHUB_ORGANIZATION_NAME** and also your GitHub personal token at **GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN**.

**You should also have your _git_ environment ready i.e. add your SSH private key if you clone by SSH for example. _gh_ must be installed, and _python3_ be ready. Obviously _gitleaks_ must be installed**
